# Kellogg's Pricing Analytics

📌 **Project Objective**  
The aim of this project is to leverage data to propose more promising pricing for Kellogg's cereals, thereby strengthening market dominance and increasing profits.

## Key Components

- 📊 **Visualizations**  
  Explore the data using visualization tools to analyze Kellogg's cereal pricing behaviors.

- 📈 **Optimal Pricing Setting**  
  Perform regression analyses to determine the optimal prices for _Family Cereal_ and _Kids Cereal_.

- 🤝 **Competition Analysis**  
  Estimate the bias introduced by not considering competitive factors through regression analysis.

- 🔮 **Predictive Modeling**  
  Develop a sales prediction model that uses price as an explanatory variable. The model predicts sales and calculates estimated profits using the optimal prices, allowing for a comparison with current pricing strategies.
